I'd like to thank everyone so far who has helped me get rid of a lot of this stuff , I was able to simultaneously get some spare funds to pay bills while also helping a friend of mine upgrade his rig to something more useful (his current build is worse off than his wife's laptop) I'll be taking the rest of his old build and turning it into a basic gaming PC for some decent 1080p action, will make a thread.

The Ryzen parts were ordered online, but I had a local offer that I took up before they arrived and used some of those in my build. I never got around to updating the BIOS on the motherboard, so it will only work with 1st gen Ryzen processors until it's updated. The 4770K system was from an old roommate, tested it with the GTX 770 everything worked no problem, same with the PSU. The HP Monitor
